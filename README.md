## Overview

Pokémon Finder is a free, open source tool to look up your favorite Pokémon.

### Built With

- [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Highlights

- First TypeScript project
  - I faced tons of problems with types at first, but I'm glad I was able to learn so much about TypeScript and the importance of types in projects (most notable enjoyments were more verbose with errors and increased prevention of build-time issues)
- Incorporates mobile-first design
- Responsive across different devices
- Consumes data from PokéAPI
  - Users can query individual Pokémon to return artwork, types, weight and height, and attributes
- Contains form validation and error handling
- Disables animation for users who prefer reduced motion
- Reinforces HTML semantics

## To-Do List

- [x] Add some pizzazz to the website
  - [x] Searchbar
  - [x] Pokémon Artwork
  - [x] Pokémon Attributes
- [x] Become responsive across all devices
